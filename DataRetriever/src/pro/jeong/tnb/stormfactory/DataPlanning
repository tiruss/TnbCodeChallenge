There are three major types film recommending mechanisms.
    1. Based on Popularity
    2. Based on Contents
    3. Based on consumer-group consensus (Collaborative Filtering)

Category 1 can be implemented with simplicity and without a huge source of data, but it is impersonal, thus cannot mirror personal tastes.
Category 2 can be implemented rather easily too, but still it is impersonal.
Category 3 can be hard to implement and needs a lot of data, but it could take into account some personal preferences.

===> What we can do with this project is unbounded, since we will have access to "Personal" datasets, which we anticipate they will reflect
personal preferences with a great magnitude. We just need to append some more data.

These "External Data" has to be information-rich, yet compact. Meaning that the data must be able to catch a very important aspect about people's
movie selecting behavior, but at the same time they must be very small in bytes. Since we only have 500$ Worth of computing power.

What I can briefly come up with is,
    1. Reviews
    2. Ratings
    3. Movie Metadata (Actors, Directors)
All three data can be easily downloaded from various dataset providers, such as Kaggle, from where I already downloaded one. But they are in English.
My opinion is that English review cannot fully reflect Korean preferences, and we have to extract that marginal preference in order to approach MAP of 17%.

The problem is how to make review data compact. I have divided this task into three steps.
    1. Extract the most-repeated 3 words from individual movie reviews.
    2. Extract most-commonly used word for movie-reviewing from various sources. Let's say, about 1000 words.
    3. Compare words extracted in step 1 with step 2, drop it if it isn't on the commonly used word deck, keep it otherwise.

*** Quick note ***
I have to come think in the perspective of our based data, THEY ARE FROM OKSUSU, and people being services by Oksusu must've
chosen next movies to watch based on THEIR RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM. If we could get a glimpse of how OKSUSU RECOMMEND movies
to their users, I think we might be able to cheat.
